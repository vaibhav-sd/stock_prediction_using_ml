        <h2>Stock Price Prediction</h2>
        <p>In this project we attempt to implement machine learning approach to predict stock prices. Machine learning is effectively implemented in forecasting stock prices. The objective is to predict the stock prices in order to make more informed and accurate investment decisions. We propose a stock price prediction system that integrates mathematical functions, machine learning, and other external factors for the purpose of achieving better stock prediction accuracy and issuing profitable trades.</p>
        <p>There are two types of stocks. You may know of intraday trading by the commonly used term "day trading." Interday traders hold securities positions from at least one day to the next and often for several days to weeks or months. LSTMs are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because theyâ€™re able to store past information. This is important in our case because the previous price of a stock is crucial in predicting its future price. While predicting the actual price of a stock is an uphill climb, we can build a model that will predict whether the price will go up or down.</p>
        <p>Time Series forecasting & modelling plays an important role in data analysis. Time series analysis is a specialized branch of statistics used extensively in fields such as Econometrics & Operation Research. Time Series is being widely used in analytics & data science. Stock prices are volatile in nature and price depends on various factors. The main aim of this project is to predict stock prices using Long short term memory (LSTM).</p>
